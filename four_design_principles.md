# Four design Principles

## Abstraction
> Is the idea of simplifying a concept in the problem domain to its essential
> within some context.
> Allows you to better understand a concept by breaking it down into a simplified
> description that ignores unimportant details.

This apply the Rule of Least Astonishment
The abstraction captures the essential attributes and behaviour for a concept
with no surprises and no definitions that fall beyond its scope. You don't want
to surprise anyone trying to understand your abstraction with irrelevant
characteristics.

## Encapsulation
> Forms a self-contained object by bundling the data and functions it requires
> to work, exposes an interface whereby other objects can access and use it, and
> restricts access to certain inside details.
> Is about making some capsule that contains some parts that you can access from
> outside and some part that you cannot. Involves these ideas:
  1. Bundle the data or functions that manipulate those values on a self contain
     object.
  2. Expose certain data and functions of that object that can be access by
     other objects.
  3. Restrict access to data and objects to be access only between that object. 

#Decomposition
> Is taking a whole thing and dividing it up into different parts.
> Or, on the flip side, taking a bunch of separate parts with different
> functionalities and combining them together to form a whole.

# Generalization
> Reduce the amount of redundancy when resolving problems.

This can be archived by inheritance of classes, adding common attributes and
behaviours on the parent class.
